READ THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT ("EULA") CAREFULLY, BECAUSE BY INSTALLING, COPYING, USING OR DISTRIBUTING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OR DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THIS EULA, DO NOT INSTALL, COPY, USE OR DISTRIBUTE THE SOFTWARE.

GENERAL: This EULA governs the use of the Software made available by or on behalf of CipherLab Co., Ltd. ("CipherLab", "we", "us" or "our"). For purposes of this EULA, "Software" means such application software, together with all components thereof and all updates, patches, fixes, modifications and enhancements thereto, including but not limited to release of new versions, whether provided to you via download, automatically without additional consent or action on your part or otherwise, and any and all accompanying documentation, files and materials.

LICENSE GRANT: Subject to your agreement and compliance with the terms and conditions of this EULA, CipherLab grants to you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable and revocable license (without the right to sublicense) to install, use, access, display and run one copy of the Software on the hard disk or other fixed storage medium of up to one (1) digital processors, computers, or workstations (collectively, "Devices") which you own or are under your control solely for your business use. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing license may not be shared or used concurrently on multiple Devices without the purchase of additional licenses from CipherLab for each such Device accessing, displaying, running, and/or using the Software. For purposes of the foregoing license grant, except for Software designated "free" or "freeware" by CipherLab (i.e., Software that does not require the payment of any license fee at any time), the continued use of the Software pursuant to Section 2 above, "LICENSE GRANT", after the expiration of the applicable "trial period" designated by CipherLab without the payment of the applicable license fee is outside the scope of the foregoing license and a violation of this EULA and United States ("U.S."), Republic of China, Taiwan ("R.O.C.") and international copyright laws.

RESTRICTIONS: The foregoing rights in and to the Software are the only rights granted to you in connection with this EULA, and any and all rights not expressly granted to you by the license described Section 2 above, "LICENSE GRANT", are expressly and fully reserved by us and/or our licensors. Your license and right to access and use the Software is limited to Devices owned or controlled by you. Except as specifically provided in this EULA or for backup or archival purposes specifically permitted by law, you may not use or make any other copies of the Software. In addition, you are not permitted to distribute, transmit, sublicense, permitted to tamper with or attempt to bypass, modify, defeat or otherwise circumvent the operation of the Software or alter, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to discover or disclose the Software source code or underlying programming or architecture.

PROPRIETARY RIGHTS: CipherLab owns all right, title and interest in and to the Software including, without limitation, all intellectual and proprietary rights appurtenant thereto, and, except for the limited license granted to you herein, nothing in this EULA shall be construed to transfer, convey, impair or otherwise adversely affect CipherLab's ownership or proprietary rights therein or any other CipherLab information or materials, tangible or intangible, in any form and in any medium.

CHANGE IN POLICIES: CipherLab Software reserve the right to change these policies at any time. While it is not our intention to do so, there may be factors outside of our control that require us to implement changes to our policies.

INSTALLATION POLICY: With all purchases, you are authorized to install the software on up to 1 device that you directly own and operate.

UPGRADE POLICY: CipherLab reserves the right to require a fee for upgrading to the new and improved version of the Software after one year from the time you purchased the Software. We highly recommend subscribing to our CipherLab Central Service ("CCS") to be informed about both minor and major updates to your applications. Also this is usually the best way to get new software and new functionality releases.

DISCONTINUED PURCHASE POLICY: As technology on the internet evolves there are times we may need to discontinue a software. When that happens, these are removed from our website and will no longer be accessible. We suggest you always keep local backups of all purchases so that you have them available to you.

TERMINATION: We have the right to terminate this license and your right to use the Software at any time for any reason, including in the event we reasonably believe you have failed to comply with any term or condition of this EULA. If this license or your right to use the Software terminates for any reason or you must stop all use of the Software and either return to us or destroy the Software and all copies of the Software that are in your possession or under your control. We may ask you to certify your compliance with the foregoing in writing, and you agree to do so if we request you to do so. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.

DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY: THERE ARE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES THAT APPLY OR THAT ARE MADE TO YOU IN ANY WAY IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THIS EULA. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE AND YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE THEREOF, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR ANY WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND/OR ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.
